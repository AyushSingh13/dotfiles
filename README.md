This was set up with the help of Jake Eisler's article: [Manage Your Dotfiles Like a Superhero](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/managing-dotfiles)

1. Clone into ~/.dotfiles
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:AyushSingh13/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

2. Run `stow` for required dotfiles, e.g.:
```bash
$ cd ~/.dotfiles

$ stow tmux
$ stow vim
```
